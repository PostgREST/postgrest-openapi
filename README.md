# PostgREST OpenAPI

SQL functions to build the OpenAPI output of a PostgREST instance.

## Roadmap

- The first step in the roadmap is to migrate the OpenAPI spec from the PostgREST core repository (version 2.0 to 3.1):
  - [x] Info object
  - [x] Server object (replaces host, basePath and schemes from OAS 2.0)
  - [ ] Components object
    - [x] Schemas (definitions in OAS 2.0)
    - [x] Security scheme (security definitions in OAS 2.0)
    - [ ] Parameters
    - [ ] Responses (produces in OAS 2.0 - simple implementation)
    - [ ] Request bodies (consumes in OAS 2.0 - simple implementation)
  - [ ] Paths object
- The next step is to fix the issues tagged with `OpenAPI` in the core repo.

## Installation

```bash
make && sudo make install
```

## Development

Check the code documentation at [/docs](/docs) to familiarize yourself with the project structure and function usage.

For testing on your local database:

```bash
# this will load fixtures in a contrib_regression db on your local postgres
make fixtures

# run the tests, they can be run repeatedly
make installcheck

# to clean the fixtures you can use
make clean
```

For an isolated and reproducible enviroment you can use [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html).

```bash
# to run tests
nix-shell --run "with-pg-15 make installcheck"

# to interact with the local database with fixtures loaded
nix-shell --run "with-pg-15 psql contrib_regression"

# you can choose the pg version
nix-shell --run "with-pg-13 make installcheck"
```

For those who insist on Docker:
```bash
# To build a docker image and run the tests in it
make docker-build-test

# To build a docker image for actual use
make docker-build
```
